# A story in DA3018

Once upon a time, by a lake called _Brunnsviken_, there was an old castle
made of red bricks. 

No one knows how old the castle was just like no one knows what the **biggest** ***prime number*** is...
Maybe it was just a coincidence and maybe it was not. Anyway...
A group of _mathematicians_ gathered here in order to figure out what the **biggest** ***prime number*** is.
But to find the biggest ***prime***, they first needed the **biggest** number.
However, finding the **biggest** number proved to be a greater task than expected. For you see, to find the **biggest** number, they needed the best and fastest counters in the whole wide world.

_"The task of finding that great number requires the work a great man"_ someone said. A conflict among the members arose — who was truly the greatest _mathematician_ in the realms of Brunnsviken?

To settle this dispute the, rather adversarial, mathematicians decided on hosting a competition — for whoever could surmount the herculian task of discovering the **biggest** number would be crowned the greatest _mathematician_ of all time.

The _mathematicians_ set out to hunt down the **largest** number. After a long and tiresome journey they unfortunately came to the agonizing realisation that there, in fact, is no largest number. After successfully having gone through the five stages of grief they thoght they finally could move on to new exciting adventures, but alas!

Those pesky _computer scientists_ a couple institutions down caught wind of their endevour, and wrote the computer program to end all computer programs, an excellent display of logic purportedly capable of solving this task.

The _mathematicians_ seethed with anger, how could those mere _computer scientists_ have solved this problem that had alluded them for centuries!? They ***HAD*** to know, but the _computer scientists_ were not telling, see they were keeping this secret to themselves as they were planning on releasing it mere months prior to the unvailing of the [Fields Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal) in hopes of snatching the crown away from the _mathematicians_.

The members gatered up and concocted a great plan, so dastardly none have yet to attempt it, a hist if you may. They were to break into the institution, in the dead of night, locate the **GREAT SUPERCOMPUTER** the _computer scientists_ used to run this calculation and ***peek*** into the source-code.

After a long and treacherous outing, they had finally done it, the _mathematicians_ stood in the hall of knowledge, at the foot of the newly constructed supercomputer, ready to find the answer they had long been waiting for. One of the _mathematicians_ nervously laid his hands on the terminal and began to type...

`ls`

 *they eagerly waited*

```

```

*he continued, fingers shaking, what if they were found out?* 

`cat LargestNumber.java`

*they waited with anticipation once more, this was it, the answer they all had been waiting for all this time, they would finally learn the truth...*

The _mathematicians_ all collectively gasped at what they found, some did not posess the stomach to take it, others even almost perished at the revolting sight they had just witnessed, it is said that ignorance is bliss and some truths are not meant to be known, the _mathematicians_ were now no strangers to this concept. 

For what layed contained withing the source file was not for the faint of heart to hande... Truly this had to be ***the biggest number***.

```java
System.out.println(Integer.MAX_VALUE)
```
